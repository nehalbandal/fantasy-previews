	Where: Air Canada Centre<br>
	The No. 1 seed Toronto Raptors face the No. 4 seed Cleveland Cavaliers.<br>
	This is the 1st game between these two teams of conference semifinal.<br>
	</p>
	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<p>Head to Head: TOR 2 - 8 CLE (last two years record)<br>
		Cleveland has played some of its best team basketball the last two games. J.R. Smith and Tristan Thompson have finally arrived. Kyle Korver is hitting threes. The Cavs compiled 25 assists last game. <br>
		The Raptors have to continue to clean up their turnovers and they need to hit more three-pointers. They rank second in the NBA postseason from beyond the arc at 39.7 percent but theyâ€™ve had two awful games in a row from long range at 32 and 28 percent.<br>
		CAV's are largely dependent on how well LeBron plays.Unlike CAV's raptors are playing team.they have few macth winners in their side.
		But throught the season we have seen the magic of LeBron James who solely can turn match in their favor. <br>
		If Raptors find way to stop James then they will surely win but if not then CAV's can go on to win this match.
