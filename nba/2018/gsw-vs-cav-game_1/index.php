	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers faces each other in the NBA Finals for the 4th straight season. GSW win 2 in last 3 finals against CAVs. LeBron James is going to play his 8th consecutive NBA Finals. Overall, this is LeBron James 9th Finals appearance. </li>
		<li>The two games played between this two teams in regular season was won by GSW. (Scores: 118-108 & 99-92) </li>
		<li>GSW are going to face less tougher challenge in the Finals than the semifinals which is vs Houston Rockets. They are much superior than CAVs in both attacking and defensive department.</li>
		<li>Except LeBron, there is no impressive performer in CAV side. J Green and T Thompson has given some good performance but that is in short burst. Except LeBron every one from CAVs lack consistency in performance.</li>
		<li>Large part of the contest can be seen as Curry, Durant, Green, K Thompson vs. LeBron James, You can imagine the mismatch in this final.</li>
		<li>LeBron James has the ability to beat this strong GSW side, But to win the series on his own is huge ask, He needs better efforts from his supporting cast he they have to win the final.</li>
		<li>A Iguodala is not going to take part in 1st game of the series whereas participation of K Love is game-time decision. There are less chances of K Love to take part in 1st game at any time.
		</li>

	</p></p>

	<p class="h">Prediction:</p><p style="color: red;font-size: 16px;"> This Final is like Thanos(LeBron) vs Avengers(GSW) <span style="color: blue"><b>:-)</b></span> Backing Golden State Warriors to win the series in 5 Games. I will go with 60-40 in GSW's favour in 1st game. </p>

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Point guard (PG)</b>: Stephen Curry is must pick. G Hill is good player but not a worthy pick at 10 credits as he is not even giving more than 20 points. Livingston and Cook are two other options. Livingston getting more game time than Cook, So prefer Livingston.      </li><br>

		<li><b>Shooting guard (SG)</b>: I think Klay Thompson is another must pick in this series as he has very good performances against CAVs (Scored 28.8 and 35.4 in regular season). Other than him Smith and Clarkson are two options available. Smith has poor record against GSW. Clarkson is good pick at 7 credits, Can give 12-13 points. Krover's poor performance forces him to start from bench. He haven't touched 10 points against GSW in regular season.   </li><br>

		<li><b>Small forward (SF) </b>: LeBron is nearly must pick. He is been top scorer in NBA Finals. K Durant has excellent record against CAVs, Scroed 54 and 59 in last two games against CAVs. R Hood and Osman has less chances of playing in the finals.  </li><br>

		<li><b>Power forward (PF)</b>: Draymond Green has averaged 47 points against CAVs in regular season games. He is completely attacking player. He can demoilished weak defence of CAVs with his aggresive nature. J Green has done good whenever he got good game time. He is going to start the game. Very good pick at 9.5 credits.      </li><br>

		<li><b>Centre (C)</b>: T Thompson, Larry, Bell and Looney, Four best options, Take at least 2. Larry and Thompson are good player. If they got good game time (Which possible in Finals) they can give you more than 20 points easily. Looney and Bell almost same amount of game time and scored in mid 20's. Prefer Looney as he starts the game.  </li><br>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Star Players (SP):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>LeBron James. </li>
		<li>Stephen Curry. </li>
		<li>Kevin Durant.</li>
		<li>Draymond Green. </li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Draymond Green is taken by less than 35% of people. Really underrated player. Excellent pick in GL as SP. </li>
		<li> Similar to Green, Durant is also the excellent pick in GL, taken by only 40% people. These two players can demolish the weak defense of CAVs.</li>
		<li> By dropping LeBron, you can go with all the 4 all stars of GSW. I think this team will collect more points than the team with LeBron, allowing more players to collect good amount points. Just need to pick SP wisely. Prefer Cuury as SP.</li>
	</ul>
