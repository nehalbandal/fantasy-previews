	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
	<li>In all leagues J Harden is going to be everyone's special player.You can take risk on C Capela and make him as special player.</li>
	<li> In GL try to pick one between D Favors,R Gobert.Really good players taken by less than 20%.</li>
	<li>There will be credit issue if we going to pick all special players. So we have to drop one or two.</li>
	</ul>
