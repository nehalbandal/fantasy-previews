	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<p>
		The 76ers will be much more well-rested after a five-game series win over Miami in the first round, and while some critics may think the extended time off is a bad thing since they haven’t played in six days, it’s going to benefit big man Joel Embiid. Embiid, who returned from an orbital fracture to play the final three games against the Heat, averaged 18.7 points and 10.3 rebounds in that span. Embiid was limited to 17.3 points on 38.5 percent shooting in three matchups vs the C’s in the regular season.
		<br>
		The Celtics, who won three of four meetings with the Sixers in the regular season, won’t have much time to rest after wrapping up a seven-game series vs Milwaukee with a convincing 112-96 home triumph on Saturday. The big question for the C’s heading into the contest is the status of Jaylen Brown, who left the clincher against the Bucks due to a hamstring injury. As of Monday morning, Brown’s status for Game 1 was doubtful.
		<br>
		This will very tight contest as both teams have great player who can turn game on their heads.

		<li>Choose SP between Embiid and Rozier.Prefer Embiid.</li>
		<li>Go with A Johnson and S Larkin if you want to manage credits</li>
		<li>By dropping Simmons, you can take Morris and Tatum.</li>
