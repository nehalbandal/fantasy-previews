	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Defending champion Golden State Warriors faces Houston Rockets in second round of conference semi-final. Both team finish 1st round of conference semi-final under five matches. In west conference Houston Rockets rank No. 1 with 65 wins which is highest among both conferences.  Whereas GSW rank 2 in same group with 58 wins.</li>
<li>
	As both teams are very strong offensively and defensively this is going to be the most enthralling round of the season. Both teams have great players in them. Rockets have likes of Harden, Capela and Chris Paul who has the capacity to dismantle the opposition whereas Warriors have Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and great Stephan Curry. </li>
<li>In regular season 3 games happened between these two sides of which 2 are won by Rockets. All three games were close, intense and competitive. And all three produced plenty of drama. And this match is also not going to be less than any thriller.</li>

	<br>
	<p class="h">Prediction:</p><p style="color: red;font-size: 16px;">  Even though Rockets beats warriors in regular rounds by 2-1 I still feel Warriors are little bit stronger than Rockets. Iâ€™m backing Warriors to win the match. </p>
	<br>
	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li><b>Point guard (PG)</b>: Chris Paul, S Curry are two best options. Curry will be good pick among both. Don't expect same kind of performance from Paul against defending champions as he done against Jazz. S Livingston and Q cook are other options. Prefer Cook.       </li><br>

		<li><b>Shooting guard (SG)</b>:  J Harden and K Thomson are two best options. J Harden can give points around 45 don't expect higher than 50. K Thomson is going to be crucial for GSW in this series. He is really fine player and can give you 30 around points. Very good pick at 14.5 crs. E Gordon and G Green bargin picks. Pick one of them depending on remaining credits don't expect more than 20 points from them.         </li><br>

		<li><b>Small forward (SF) </b>: K Durrant has score 43 and 40.5 against two games that they played in regular season. Expect points in between 45 to 50. Prefer him over Harden. Iguodala is good pick at 10 crs can give you 15 points easily. Ariza comes from bench, can give you 10-12 points. Pick at least one of them.            </li><br>

		<li><b>Power forward (PF)</b>:  Draymond green is must pick. In 19 crs he has potential to led scoring charts. PJ Trucker will be very handy pick at 8 crs he can give points around 25. Luc Moute comes from bench can give you 10 points easily. Really good pick.     </li><br>

		<li><b>Centre (C)</b>: Clint Capela is only the best option we have. He is in really fine form, aggresive player, can give you 40 around points easily. K Looney is another considerable option available. At 7 crs he can give you 15 around points.                  </li><br>
	</ul>
	<p class="h">Star Players (SP):</p>
	<ul > 
		<li>Stephan Curry. </li>
		<li>Draymond Green. </li>
		<li>Kevin Durant. </li>
		<li>James Harden.</li>
		<li>Clint Capela.</li>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li>Draymond Green is taken by 40% people. As i said earlier he has potential to led scoring charts. So try to pick him. Very good option for SP. </li>
		<li>Not lot of players going to have S Curry as their SP. He is one of the greatest PG. In GL you can make him SP.  </li>
	</ul>
