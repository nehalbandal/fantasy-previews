	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Boston Celtics are going to host the last match of the series. Playing in front of home fans could be the difference in who will reach the NBA final. </li>
<li> Cavaliers got major set back as in form Kevin Love is out from the game 7 due to injury. Jeff is going to start in place of Love.  </li>
<li> Except 1st game of the series LeBron is outstanding. He is giving is everything out to reach the final. All depends on his supporting cast whether CAV's go through or not.</li>
<li> For CAV's, Only LeBron and Love are producing consistent performances. They need points from Korver, Smith and Green. G Hill need to replicate his last match performance in this all-important match.</li>
<li> For Boston, Tatum and Horford's underperformance in this series is a big concern. Terry Rozier has come excellent in last three games. Smart and Morris are doing their supporting duties very well. </li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Boston Celtics</p>
	
	<b>Probable starters:</b> 
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Terry Rozier  </li>
		<li>Jaylen Brown</li>
		<li>Jayson Tatum  </li>
		<li>Al Horford </li>
		<li>Aron Baynes </li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p class="subs">
	<b>From bench:</b> Marcus Morris, Semi Ojeleye , Shane Larkin, Abdel Nader, Marcus Smart.<br>
	<b>Injuries & Game-time Decisions: </b> Gordon Hayward, Kyrie Irving, Daniel Theis.<br>
	<b>Last 5 games : W L L W L</b> <br>
	</p>

	<p class="h">Cleveland Cavaliers</p>
	<p >
	<b>Probable starters:</b> 
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>George Hill  </li>
		<li>Kyle Korver  </li>
		<li>JR Smith  </li>
		<li>LeBron James  </li>

	</p></p>

	<p class="h">Prediction:</p><p style="color: red;font-size: 16px;"> With K Love injured, Shifts the pendulum in Celtics favour slightly. But LeBron James can win the match for CAV's on his own. Backing Cavaliers with 60-40.</p>

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Point guard (PG)</b>: Rozier and Hill are best options. I think both are must pick. Larkin haven't been use in this series. Calderon has very less chances of playing.      </li><br>

		<li><b>Shooting guard (SG)</b>: Brown and Smart are two good options. Smart has consistently given 25 above point. J Brown has performed well in front of home crowd and averages around 35 points in home court. In between Korver and Smith, Korver is consistent and effective. Clarkson can be very good pick at 7 credits.    </li><br>

		<li><b>Small forward (SF) </b>: LeBron Jame is mandatory pick. Tatum is not consistent in this series. But he has potential to perform well in this high pressure game. Hood and Ojeleye are other two options. But won't be worthy pick.</li><br>

		<li><b>Power forward (PF)</b>: Morris's performance is down after 1st two games. You can expect around 20 points from him. Green is good player and he going to start the game so can expect 25 around points from him.    </li><br>

		<li><b>Centre (C)</b>: At 16 credits Horford giving points around 30, not worthy pick at 16 credits. Thompson, Baynes and Nance Jr. are 3 excellent pick. Baynes and Nance are consistently giving 20+ points, which makes them must pick.   </li><br>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Star Players (SP):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>LeBron James. </li>
		<li>Terry Rozier. </li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Al Horford has been taken by less than 30% of players. In 1st home game he has scored 45 points. He is capeble of replicating that performance is this big game.</li>
		<li>Brown has been picked by 35% of people. He really good player. Had good record at home court.</li>
		<li>Though Tatum's performance is up and down in this series, He is excellent in this season. If he plays upto his potential he can give you 35+ points easily. </li>
	</ul>
