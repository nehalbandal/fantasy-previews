			<li>N Mirotic and K Thompson are taken by less players. In GL you can go with A Davis, Mirotic and Thompson in one team.</li>
			<li>There will be lot credit issue if we going to pick all special players. So we have to drop one or two.</li>
			<li>Invest less in this match because of so many good players who has the capablity to score plenty of points, but due to credit issue we can't take all of the. So invest wisely.</li>
