	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Defending champions Warriors are on the way out of the league if they lose the 6th game of the series. They 2-3 down and have to come up strong against Houston Rockets.</li>
<li>
		Warriors have the talent and big match temperament players on their side. They have to come up good together if they want to keep this series alive. Stephan Curry is big match player. He needs support from Durrant, Thompson and D Green. Klay Thompson is dealing with a sore knee from 4th game of the series.</li>
<li>
		It will be going to be a high intense game. Harden has a pretty average game last time out but he will determine to finish the series by another solid performance.</li>

	<br>
	<p class="h">Prediction:</p><p style="color: red;font-size: 16px;"> Even though Rockets beats warriors in regular rounds by 2-1 I still feel Warriors are little bit stronger than Rockets. Iâ€™m backing Warriors to win the match. </p>
	<br>
	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips:</p>
	<ul style="margin-left: 5%;" style="text-align: justify;"> 
		<li><b>Point guard (PG)</b>: Chris Paul, S Curry are two best options. Curry is must pick. Paul is also giving 35+ points. S Livingston and Q cook are other options. Prefer Cook.       </li><br>

		<li><b>Shooting guard (SG)</b>:  J Harden and K Thomson are two best options. K Thomson can give you 30 around points. Very good pick at 14.5 crs. E Gordon, Young and G Green bargain picks. Pick one or two of them depending on remaining credits.         </li><br>

		<li><b>Small forward (SF) </b>: K Durrant has given points around 45. Ariza is another good bargin pick, can give you 15-20 points at 8.5 crs.</li><br>

		<li><b>Power forward (PF)</b>:  Draymond green is not performing at his best levels consistently in this series which can be seen in his points. But he is really good players. He had 15 rebounds, most in the last game. PJ Trucker has averaged around 24 points in this series.     </li><br>

		<li><b>Centre (C)</b>: Clint Capela is only the best option we have. But his performance is similar to D Green. K Looney is another considerable option available. At 7 crs he can give you 15 around points.    </li><br>
	</ul>
	<p class="h">Star Players (SP):</p>
	<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul style="margin-left: 5%;" style="text-align: justify;"> 
		<li>Draymond Green is taken by 40% of people. As I said earlier he has potential to led scoring charts. So try to pick him. Very good option for SP. </li>
		<li>K Durrant has been picked by only 40% of people. He is one of the best players in the league. Try him SP in GL, He worths.</li>
		<li>Capela has found his rhythm in last game. Will be a handy pick in GL. </li>
	</ul>
