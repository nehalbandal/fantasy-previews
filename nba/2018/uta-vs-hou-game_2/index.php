	</p>
	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<p>Head to Head : HOU 10 - 1 UTA. <br>
		The Houston Rockets kicked off their second-round series with the Utah Jazz with a convincing 110-96 victory in Game 1, and the Rockets look to grab a 2-0 lead in Game 2 on Wednesday. The Jazz are 10-1 SU in their past 11 after dropping the previous game.<br>
		Star guard James Harden paved the way for the Rockets like he usually does by collecting a team-high 41 points in the triumph. In four meetings with the Jazz in the regular season, Harden averaged 34.3 points and had one 56-point outing. The veteran’s success is especially impressive since the Jazz ranked sixth in scoring defense at 102.4 during the campaign. Backup shooting guard Eric Gordon had an off game in Game 1 by missing all six of his shots. Gordon is shooting just 31.4 percent from the field in the playoffs.<br>
		It's intresting to see how underdogs will respond in game 2.They had the caliber to beat any team as they have shown in round 1. But they have to find solution to stop J harden.<br>
		Houston Rockets are hot favourites as they lost only 7 games at home during the regular season and are unbeaten at Toyota Center in the postseason. It will be difficult for Jazz to stop Rockets in their home arena.
