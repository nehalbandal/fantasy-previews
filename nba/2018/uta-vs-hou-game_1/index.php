	</p>
	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<p>Head to Head : HOU 9 - 1 UTA. <br>
		The Utah Jazz proved they are the real deal with their 4-2 series victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder but they need to take a big leap forward if they want to top the Houston Rockets in the second round. The Jazz went 0-4 straight-up and against the spread against the Rockets this season while being outscored by an average of 17.5 points per game.<br>
Offensively, the Jazz struggled against the Rockets this season – averaging just 98.8 points per game while shooting 44.3% from the floor and 30% from 3PT range vs Houston. However, the Jazz offense looked like it was playing at another level during their first-round series thanks to the backcourt duo of Donovan Mitchell and Ricky Rubio. Mitchell and Rubio combined to average 42.5 points, 14.5 assists and 13 rebounds during the postseason so far.<br>
Houston Rockets are hot favourites as they lost only 7 games at home during the regular season and are unbeaten at Toyota Center in the postseason. It will be difficult for Jazz to stop Rockets in their home arena. </p>
