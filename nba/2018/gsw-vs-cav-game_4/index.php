	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Kevin Durant, 43 Pts 13 Reb 7 Ast. The main reason for win Golden State Warriors in Game 3 on NBA Finals taking the 3-0 lead. </li><br>
		<li> Splash brothers and Draymond Green had a completely off game. Steph Curry, Who sets the record of most 3-pointers in a game of NBA Finals, managed to score only one 3-pointer and that too in last quarter. Appearance Iguodala doesn't have a much good impact. </li><br>
		<li> For almost 3 quarters CAVS have the lead. They started exceptionally well. At one stage they have 13 point lead. The trio of LeBron, Love, and Smith is doing the large part of scoring. </li><br>
		<li> The introduction of R Hood has given new spark to CAV side. Hood shows good offensive skills scoring 15 Pts and 6 Reb. The mistake done by CAVS is in gaurding Durant.</li><br>
		<li> Love and LeBron makes errors at crucial times in last half of quarter 3 and start of quarter 4. That's the period where GSW first time in the game got a lead and from there on they snatch a victory from CAVS.   </li><br>
		<li> GSW will look to sweep out CAVS and win make hattrick NBA Titles. CAVS have to avoid commiting errors at defense. Overall they are good to win game 4.</li>

	<p class="h">Prediction:</p><p style="color: red;font-size: 16px;"> I'm seeing Golden State Warriors clinching the NBA Titles 3rd time in row. I feel Steph Curry will come hard in Game 4 to make amends for is last game performance.  </p>

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Point guard (PG)</b>: Though Stephan Curry has really had worst performance in last game, I still think he is must pick. Livingston is excellent in last two games. Very good pick at 5.5 credits. At 10 credits, I still think G Hill is not a worthy pick because he is not performing consistently well. Rest is your decision.     </li><br>

		<li><b>Shooting guard (SG)</b>: Here J.R.Smith is must pick. K thompson is not up to the mark in this series so far. Try him in GL, In small leagues, I don't think he worth at 14.5 credits. Clarkson is a good player, but he is not getting sufficient game time. </li><br>

		<li><b>Small forward (SF) </b>: LeBron is nearly must pick. No Need to talk much about him. I don't think there is any reason that Durant will fail in Game 4 to score at least 50 points. For me he is must pick, Rest is your decision. R Hood is a good pick at 6.5. He is going to get more game time. He has good shooting skills. I think Iguodala at 9.5 credits won't be a good pick. He is in team mostly for gaurding LeBron.</li><br>

		<li><b>Power forward (PF)</b>: K Love is nearly must pick. Excellent in the shooting. Draymond is now become an only GL pick because of his inconsistent performance. On his day he can score more than 50, Otherwise, around 30 points are almost fixed. J Green has bad last game, but he is a good player.      </li><br>

		<li><b>Centre (C)</b>: At 5.5 credits JaVale McGee is a very good pick, Can give you in between 15 to 20 points. Simillarly T Thompson can give you in between 15 to 20 points. If R Hood continues giving good performance in Game 4, Larry is not going to get enough game time. Bell and Looney, both are good players but looks like GSW is preferring Bell over Looney.  </li><br>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Star Players (SP):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>LeBron James. </li>
		<li>Stephan Curry. </li>
		<li>Kevin Durant.</li>
		<li>Draymond Green. </li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Just because of one bad performance There is a huge drop in the selection of Steph Curry. Keep faith in him. He will deliver good in Game 4.</li><br>
		<li> As I said earlier Draymond Geen is not consistent with is performances. But he is a good aggressive player. He is more like a playmaker. He will very handy with his assists and blocks which he has shown in Game 1.</li><br>
		<li> The team 2 (without LeBron james) that I have given in last match preview has done well all leagues. You can go with that team again in GL with one or two changes. Refer my team 2. </li>
