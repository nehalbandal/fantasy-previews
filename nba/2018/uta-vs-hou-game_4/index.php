	<p>Head to Head : HOU 11 - 2 UTA. <br>
		<br>Compared to last games this was really easy game for rockets as they beat Jazz comfortably by 113-92.
		For Jazz, No one played upto their potential. D Mitchell is again having bad day at office. Among others R Gobert and O'Neale perform better, but they still can't avoid big margin of loss.<br>
		For Rockets, its again complete team performance. J Harden and E Gordon scores 50 pts each.
		In game 4 its going to be big task for jazz to challenge mighty Rockets.

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
	<li>In all leagues J Harden is going to be everyone's special player.You can take risk on C Capela and make him as special player.</li>
	<li> In GL try to pick one between D Favors,R Gobert.Really good players taken by less than 20%.</li>
	<li>There will be credit issue if we going to pick all special players. So we have to drop one or two.</li>
	</ul>
