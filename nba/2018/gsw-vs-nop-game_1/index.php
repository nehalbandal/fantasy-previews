			<br>
		</p>
		<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
		<p>Head to Head: GSW 14 - 1 NOP.
			<br>The New Orleans Pelicans might be the hottest team in the NBA playoffs right now, as Anthony Davis and company have won nine-straight games. During that winning streak, the Pelicans have averaged 118.2 points per game with an average scoring margin of +16 ppg.<br>
			History will not be on the Pelicans’ side in this one with New Orleans winning just one of their last 15 games against the Warriors. That being said, the Pelicans did defeat the Warriors in their most recent meeting less than four weeks ago. That game saw most of the Warriors best players take the floor but the team made the choice to go small – with centers accounting for a combined 10 minutes of playing time – leading to Davis and Nikola Mirotic to score 62 points.<br>
			Warriors are largely dependent on K Durrant and K Thompson. The duo has scored 50% of warriors points. Golden State's No. 1-ranked offense averaging 113.05 PPG, against a New Orleans Pelicans defense that ranks No. 28 at 110.19 PPG. The Golden State Warriors field goal percentage has averaged 50.17% so far, more than the New Orleans Pelicans shooters have achieved on the year, 48.55% per game.GSW are clearly favourite for this match and even for this series.<br></p>

		<ul >
			<li>There will be lot credit issue if we going to pick all special players. So we have to drop one or two.</li>
			<li>S Curry is in doubt. But can be introduce from bench. He is great player. In GL you can try him in one of your team.</li>
			<li>Invest less in this match because of so many good players who has the capablity to score plenty of points, but due to credit issue we can't take all of the. So invest wisely.</li>
