	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<ul>
		<li>LeBron James nearly took the game 1 away from GSW, But the errors commited by 1st K Thompson and end then G Hill miss the crucial free throw at very end of quarter 4 forces match into over-time which is completely dominated by GSW. </li>
		<li>LeBron James, Continuing his great run in NBA Finals. He has scored 51 points which highest ever in NBA Finals with 8 assists and 8 rebounds.</li>
		<li>K Love's presense made LeBron's job bit easier. Love on his return to the team scored 21 points 1 assists and 13 rebounds. Larry Nance Jr. is another impressive performer from CAVs. He has scored 9 points and 11 rebounds only in 19 minutes.</li>
		<li>From GSW, Every one has played exceptionally well, Only concern from them is the low percentage of sucessfull 3 pointers. They have missed lot of 3 Pointers in game 1. Thats one of the reason why CAVs are always closer to GSW in game.</li>
		<li>Among 4 All-stars of GSW, Draymond green was very impressive. He was aggresive and very good at defensive duties. Though he has missed on lot occasion on scoring points. K Thompson got injured in 6th minute of 1st quarter and haven't played for rest of quarter 1.</li>

	<p class="h">Prediction:</p><p style="color: red;font-size: 16px;"> I'm still persisting with GSW to win the game even though LeBron nearly takes the game 1 away from GSW. Predicting 55-45 in GSW's favour. </p>

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Point guard (PG)</b>: Stephan Curry is must pick. G Hill is good player but not a worthy pick at 10 credits as he is not even giving more than 20 points. Livingston and Cook are two other options. Livingston getting more game time than Cook, So prefer Livingston.      </li><br>

		<li><b>Shooting guard (SG)</b>: I still think K thompson is going to be crucial pick. He is good players. Keep in mind that he played last game with injury. Other than him Smith and Clarkson are two options available. Both are good picks at their given credits. Pick at least 1. Korver has poor record against GSW and it can be seen in game 1.   </li><br>

		<li><b>Small forward (SF) </b>: LeBron is nearly must pick. No Need to talk much about him. As I said in game 1, K Durant has excellent record against CAVs, He has shown in it in game 1. R Hood and Osman has less chances of playing in the finals.  </li><br>

		<li><b>Power forward (PF)</b>: 46, 48 and 58.7 this are the points of Draymond against CAVs. I already told in game 1 and in playoff matches against Rockets tha he has the ability to led the scoring chart. He is an excellent pick at 19 credits. K Love is impressive since playoff series against Celtics, scoring more than 30 points in almost all games. J Green has done good whenever he got good game time. As Love is fit, Jeff Green is going to start  from the bench. Very good pick at 9.5 credits.      </li><br>

		<li><b>Centre (C)</b>: T Thompson, Larry, Bell and Looney, Four best options, Take at least 2. Larry and Thompson are good player. If they got good game time (Which possible in Finals) they can give you more than 20 points easily. Looney and Bell almost same amount of game time and scored in mid 20's. Prefer Looney as he starts the game.  </li><br>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Star Players (SP):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>LeBron James. </li>
		<li>Stephan Curry. </li>
		<li>Kevin Durant.</li>
		<li>Draymond Green. </li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Because of last match performance, Klay Thompson is taken by less than 30% of players. He is great player. Very good pick in GL.  </li>
		<li>K Love is also taken by less than 30% of players. He is in good form since last playoff series. Good co-ordination with LeBron will definately boost his points tally. </li>
		<li>There is huge drop in percentage of selections of J Green and T Thompson. At there credits they have the ability to give around 20 points.</li>
		
	</ul>
