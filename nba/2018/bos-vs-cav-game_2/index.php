	<ul><li>The tactics that is predicted before match to have different defenders against LeBron James has worked quite well as Boston able keep him quiet and able to win game 1 with score of 108-83. From Boston, Every one has performed exceptionally well.
	</li>
		<li> M Morris got chance to start the game and he make that start count with 21 points and 10 rebounds. The duo of J Brown and Al Horford comes harder at cavaliers scoing 43 points in between them. J Brown coming from an injury look like beast on court. Cavaliers don't have the answer to his attacking play.
		</li>
		<li>
		From Cavaliers, Except K Love no one has step up. From bench R Hood and J Clarkson comes with good but cavaliers never look in control thoughout the game. LeBron James is not able to put his best performance scoring only 15 pts 9 asts and 7 rebs. He is very well gaurded by Boston, They never let him free. </li>

	<br>
	<p class="h">Prediction:</p><p style="color: red;font-size: 16px;">  Boston are going to be favourite in this match with their going harder at opponetnts play. 55-45% in Boston's favour.   </p>
	<br>
	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li><b>Point guard (PG)</b>: Rozier and Hill are best options.Rozier can give 35+ points. Expect around 15-20 points from Hill. He is good player. Pick Larkin or calderon to manage credits, prefer larkin.                </li><br>

		<li><b>Shooting guard (SG)</b>:  Brown, Smart, Krover and Smith are best options available. Pick at least two. Smart is mandatory pick. Pick one between Krover and smith. Clarkson starts from bench. Can give more than 10 points easily. J Brown is going to be crucial pick in GL. He is in good form and can give more than 30+ points.            </li><br>

		<li><b>Small forward (SF) </b>: LeBron James is mandatory pick. Another best option is J Tatum. S Ojeleye is another option with R Hood. But they don’t worth as they haven’t get sufficient game time.           </li><br>

		<li><b>Power forward (PF)</b>:  Al Horford is best option available. Consistently giving 35+ points. Morris, Green and Larry are other options available. Pick at least one. Prefer M Morris as he consistently scoring more than 20+. Larry Jr. get very less game time. J Green’s performance is dependent on game time he gets. He is good player.            </li><br>

		<li><b>Centre (C)</b>:    K Love and A Baynes are best options available. Both are in good form. Baynes is best bargain pick. In last 3 games against raptors K Love was outstanding almost scoring above 40. But it’s tough to replicate that performance against this strong Celtics team. T Thompson got good game time, and he delivered.His game is more dependent on how well LeBeon plays.                 </li><br>
