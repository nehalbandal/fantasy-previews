	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Stephen Curry's NBA Finals record of 9 3-pointers in a game gives GSW an easy win in game 2.</li><br>
		<li> For CAVs story remains same, Only LeBron and K Love are performing. Surprisingly Jeff Green and Larry Nance Jr. who are another consistent performers got only 20 and 12 minutes of game time only. In last game they never got lead, they always chasing the games.</li><br>
		<li> If Cavaliers wants to stay alive in the Finals then supporting cast of LeBron's has to step up. LeBron is giving his all in every game but still not able to find a win for CAV's.</li><br>
		<li>Except Draymond Green, everyone has played upto their potential. Steph Curry was again amazing, Durant is very efficient in his shots than game 1. JaVale McGee got chance to start the game and has done well in 18 minutes of his game time.</li>
		
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Prediction:</p><p style="color: red;font-size: 16px;"> Expecting Golden State Warriors to win, but they will find littel difficult in CAVs home court. </p>

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Point guard (PG)</b>: Stephan Curry is must pick. I don't think G Hill will able to replicate his last game performance. Expecting around 20 points from him. Livingston is excellent in last two games. Very good pick at 5.5 credits     </li><br>

		<li><b>Shooting guard (SG)</b>: K thompson is has given average performances in two games. Try him in GL, In small leagues I don't think he worth at 14.5 credits. Other considerable options are Smith and Clarkson. Both are good picks at their given credits. Pick at least 1. </li><br>

		<li><b>Small forward (SF) </b>: LeBron is nearly must pick. No Need to talk much about him. I think Durant is another must pick, as he can give more than 50 points against this CAVs side.   </li><br>

		<li><b>Power forward (PF)</b>: Draymond green has rare failure in last game against CAVs. I have already talk about his playing ability in last two game.K Love is another good pick at 15.5 credits. He can give more than 35 points. I think J Green is going to get more time game than last game. Very good pick at 9.5 credits. He Can give around 25 points. David West has good last game but before that he was not good.      </li><br>

		<li><b>Centre (C)</b>: I don't think T Thompson is very good pick at 9 credits, Purely on way how he has played in last two games. I think Larry is going to get more time game in game 3. He is very good pick at 7.5 credits.
		Looney was not upto the mark in last game but overall good player, Good pick at 6 credits. JaVale Mcgee and Jordan Bell are another good options. McGee can be handy pick at 5.5 credits.  </li><br>
	</ul>

		<li>LeBron James. </li>

	<br>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Because of last match performance, Klay Thompson and both Green's are taken by less than 30% of players. Pick atleaast two of them in GL. Draymond and Jeff Green is pair to pick. </li><br>
		<li>Even by dropping LeBron, Your team can perform well, just pick SP wisely. Take a look at my 2nd team.</li><br>
		<li> A Iguodala is nearly fit and has chances to play in game 3. This will be a very risky pick, as we can't predict the amount of game time he going to get. But he is a very good player. </li>
	</ul>
