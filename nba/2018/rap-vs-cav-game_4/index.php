	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<p>Head to Head: TOR 2 - 11 CLE (last two years record)<br>
		It's again LeBron james show.Again single handedly he has taken game away from raptor by scoring 34 pts 7 ast and 6 rebs.
		<br>
		Another poor performance from DeRozan and Valanciunas. They aren't at their best scoring only 18 pts, and this results into their defeat.K Lowry was impressive as he manages 27 pts 7 ast and 3 rebs.. They have to pull up their socks and have find way to stop James other wise their camagian will going to over.
		<br>
		CAV's are largely dependent on how well LeBron plays.Unlike CAV's raptors are playing team.they have few macth winners in their side.
		But throught the season we have seen the magic of LeBron James who solely can turn match in their favor. <br>
		Backing cavaliers to win this game easily.

	<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
		<li>There will be credit issue if we going to pick all four special players. So we have to drop one.</li>
		<li>In any league James is going to be everone's captain.But if you drop him you can pick Lowry, Wright and Love which are very good players.This move will be very intresting and can give you grand league if james have even slight of day.</li>
		<li>If you drop James, DeRozan and Jonas are another best options for special player.</li>
