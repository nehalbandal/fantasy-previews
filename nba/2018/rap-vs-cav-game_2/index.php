	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<p>Head to Head: TOR 2 - 9 CLE (last two years record)<br>
		What a thriller that was in Game 1. Toronto Raptors’ Game 1 demons came back to haunt them in the opener of their second-round series against the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Dinos face a must-win Game 2 on Thursday before the series shifts to Ohio.<br>
		The Cavs managed to pull out a win despite getting an off night (by his standards) from LeBron James – something they didn’t do much of in the 2017-18 regular season. James recorded his 21st triple-double but went 12-for-30 from the field and 1-for-6 from the foul line, while Kyle Korver connected on five of his 12 three-point attempts from beyond the arc. Over the last two seasons, Cleveland has now hit at least 13 three-pointers in all five playoff games vs Toronto.<br>
		The Raps, who were leading by 13 in the second half, committed 14 turnovers while forcing just six. In the postseason, Toronto has coughed up the ball 17 more times than their opponents. Jonas Valanciunas was a bright spot, however, as the big man recorded 21 points and 21 rebounds in Game 1.<br>
		CAV's are largely dependent on how well LeBron plays.Unlike CAV's raptors are playing team.they have few macth winners in their side.
		But throught the season we have seen the magic of LeBron James who solely can turn match in their favor. <br>
		If Raptors find way to stop James then they will surely win but if not then CAV's can go on to win this match.
