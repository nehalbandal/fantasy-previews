	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Win or go home. This is situation infront of both the teams. Winner will go straight in to the finals. </li>
		<li> Golden State Warriors put dominant performance in last game. klay Thompson rises to the occasion and led GSW to victory. Rockets were never in the game. Chris Paul's absense is big reason for the Rockets poor performance.</li>
		<li>Chris Paul is doubtful for the final game. With Paul's absense, Scoring duties will be huge on Harden and Gordon. Capela's underperformance is really suprising in this series. He his really good player and He have to come in to prime form if Rockets want to reach the finals. </li>
		<li> Defending champions are familiar with the big matches. They know how to perform in knock-out matches. They have shown in last match by outplaying Rockets.</li>
		<li>With Thompson and Green coming in to form at right time, GSW find themselves at very good position to reach the finals once again. </li>
