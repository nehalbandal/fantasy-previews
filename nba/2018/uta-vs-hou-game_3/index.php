		<p>Head to Head : HOU 10 - 2 UTA.
			<br>The Utah Jazz claimed home-court advantage from the best team in the NBA after taking one game from the Rockets in Houston and will look to keep their surprising run going in Game 3 on Friday.
			<br>After dropping all four regular-season matchups with the Rockets, the Jazz pulled out a gritty 116-108 triumph over Houston in Game 2. Utah shot 51.8 percent and used a 14-2 run in the game’s final frame to dispatch James Harden and company. Joe Ingles hit a career-high seven three-pointers in nine attempts en route to a team-high 27 points in Game 2.
			<br>Now the action moves in Vivint Smart Home Arena, home of utah where they haven't loss in their last 7 games. It's intresting to see how underdogs will respond in game 2.They had the caliber to beat any team as they have shown in round 1. But they have to find solution to stop J harden.

		<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
			<li>In all leagues J Harden is going to be everyone's special player.You can take risk on C Capela and make him as special player.</li>
			<li>In GL try to pick one between D Favors,R Gobert.Really good players taken by less than 20%.</li>
			<li>There will be credit issue if we going to pick all special players. So we have to drop one or two.</li>
