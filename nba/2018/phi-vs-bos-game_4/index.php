	<li>Try to make team which include D Saric and Al Horford. They are really best. But for that you have to drop Embiid and Rozier.</li>
		<li>Choose SP between Embiid and Rozier.Prefer Embiid.</li>
		<li>Go with A Johnson and S Larkin if you want to manage credits</li>
		<li>Simmons is taken by very less players just because of is last performance but he really talented player, Try him in GL.</li>
