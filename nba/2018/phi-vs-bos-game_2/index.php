			<li>There will be credit issue if we going to pick all special players. So we have to drop one or two.</li>
			<li>Try to make team which include J Tatum and Al Horford. They are really best. But for that you have to drop Embiid and simmons.</li>
			<li>Choose SP between Embiid and Rozier.Prefer Embiid.</li>
			<li>Go with A Johnson and S Larkin if you want to manage credits</li>
			<li>By dropping Simmons, you can take Morris and Tatum.</li>
