	<ul>
		<li>Boston Celtics will host 1st two games of conference semi-finals against Cleveland cavaliers. Celtics defeated 76ers in conference semi-final round 1 by 4-1 whereas cavaliers beat raptors in 4 straight games to reach conference semi-final round 2.</li>
<li> In regular season cavaliers beat Celtics in 2 of 3 games played. In all the game LeBron James has led the scoring chart, following him was the Rozier.</li>
<li>
It will be interesting to see what tactics Celtics use to stopped James as he is going to be the difference in both sides. Celtics have to use alternate defender against LeBron to unsettle him. H Brown, J Tatum and M Morris are going to play crucial part in this series as they to do defensive duty against LeBron.</li>
<li>
It is going to be interesting tussle between this two attacking two teams. Certainly LeBron is going to dictate every minute he is going to play and that’s make cavaliers favourite to boss the game.</li>

	<p class="h">Prediction:</p><p style="color: red;font-size: 16px;"> LeBron James is going to be big factor in this match. Backing Cavaliers to win this match. </p>
	
	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li><b>Point guard (PG)</b>: Rozier and Hill are best options.Rozier can give 35+ points. Expect around 20 points from Hill. He is good player. Pick Larkin or calderon to manage credits, prefer larkin.                </li><br>

		<li><b>Shooting guard (SG)</b>:  Brown, Smart, Krover and Smith are best options available. Pick at least two. Smart is mandatory pick. Pick one between Krover and smith. Clarkson starts from bench. Can give more than 10 points easily. J Brown is going to be crucial pick in GL. He is in good form and can give more than 30+ points.            </li><br>

		<li><b>Small forward (SF) </b>: LeBron James is mandatory pick. Another best option is J Tatum. S Ojeleye is another option with R Hood. But they don’t worth as they haven’t get sufficient game time.           </li><br>

		<li><b>Power forward (PF)</b>:  Al Horford is best option available. Consistently giving 35+ points. Morris, Green and Larry are other options available. Pick at least one. Prefer M Morris as he consistently scoring more than 20+. Larry Jr. get very less game time. J Green’s performance is dependent on game time he gets. He is good player.            </li><br>

		<li><b>Centre (C)</b>:    K Love and A Baynes are best options available. Both are in good form. Baynes is best bargain pick. In last 3 games against raptors K Love was outstanding almost scoring above 40. But it’s tough to replicate that performance against this strong Celtics team.                  </li><br>

	<ul > 
		<li>LeBron James. </li>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li>Al Horford is taken by less than 40%. He is really good player which we have seen against 76ers. You can expect 40+ points from him which will give you huge boost in GL.</li>
	<li>J Brown is coming from an injury and he is getting back in his form. He has very good games against cavaliers in regular 
	season scored almost 35 points in each game. Try to pick him. And he will be helpful to manage credits well.</li>
	</ul>
