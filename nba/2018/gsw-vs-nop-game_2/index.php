		<ul >
			<li>There will be lot credit issue if we going to pick all special players. So we have to drop one or two.</li>
			<li>S Curry is on his way back to main team but he can be introduce from bench. As told earlier he is legend. In GL you can make him special player. He worths.</li>
			<li>Invest less in this match because of so many good players who has the capablity to score plenty of points, but due to credit issue we can't take all of the. So invest wisely.</li>
