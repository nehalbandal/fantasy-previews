		<h2>Dream 11 Tips and Tricks for NBA and Football matches. </h2>
		<br>
		<p> After years of experiance of playing Fantasy games on platforms like Dream11, Halaplay and MyTeam11, I am Here to provide you tips and tricks for winning in fantasy leagues. Competion in Dream11 is increasing day by day as the popularity of this game is increasing. But if you look there is less competition in Football and NBA as compared to cricket. There is huge opportunity for everyone to win big in Football and NBA games if you played wisely and use some tips and tricks that I'm going to share. </p>
		<br>
		<ul class="nba">
			<h2><i class="fa fa-dribbble" style="color: #d63131;"></i> NBA</h2>

			<li><i class="fa fa-dribbble" style="color: #d63131;"></i> While selecting team, try to pick those players who get most of game time. There are some  players who start from bench but get more game time than those who starts the match.</li>

			<li><i class="fa fa-dribbble" style="color: #d63131;"></i> I have observed in Dream11 that lots of people pick the players on the basis of their last match or atmost last two match performance. Don't loose faith in good players even if they had one or two bad games.
			</li>

			<li><i class="fa fa-dribbble" style="color: #d63131;"></i> Before making Dream 11 team for any match, make sure to check both teams attacking and defensive strengths. Don't just make team only on past match performances.</li>

			<li><i class="fa fa-dribbble" style="color: #d63131;"></i> In NBA games some player have excellent records at home court. Try to include these players in team irrespective of thier past performances. </li>

		</ul>
	<br>
		<ul class="football">
			<h2><i class="fa fa-futbol-o" style="color: purple"></i> FOOTBALL</h2>
			
			<li><i class="fa fa-futbol-o" style="color: purple"></i> Always cheack last 5 match score lines of both the team. Also Score lines of head to head games. This will give fair idea about teams attacking and defensive strengths.</li>

			<li><i class="fa fa-futbol-o" style="color: purple"></i> From team who is defensively strong try to pick at least 3 defenders with goal keeper.</li>

			<li><i class="fa fa-futbol-o" style="color: purple"></i> From team who has strong attack, try to pick all the forwards as they at least can contribute from "Shots on target". Also it will be good move to pick opponents goal keeper, as he can contribute from "Saves", if there are less chances of clean sheets from both teams. 
			</li>

			<li><i class="fa fa-futbol-o" style="color: purple"></i> In grand leagues, when there are too much good players available with high credits, prefer those who are selected by more number of peoples.</li>

			<li><i class="fa fa-futbol-o" style="color: purple"></i> When there is high chances of one team going to have clean sheets then don't hesitate to take all defenders and keepers from that team.</li>
			
			<li><i class="fa fa-futbol-o" style="color: purple"></i> While picking C and VC from defenders, check their passing and tackling stats of at least last five games. Remember wing backs have high chance of picking up assists as they provide crosses in box.   </li>
			
			<li><i class="fa fa-futbol-o" style="color: purple"></i> In GL, try to pick player from subs who has the ability to score goal or assist. This will very good pick in GL.</li>
		</ul>
