<p class="h">Prediction:</p>
<div class="pred">
<ul>
<li> Atlanta United are in excellent form this season. Table position is enough to indicate their run this year. </li>
<li> At home, Atlanta United looks much stronger. Their home record is proof of that.</li>
<li> Seattle Sounders not been in great form. On away trip they have lost 5 out of their 9 games.</li>
<li> Only positive thing for Seattle is that they had scored in almost every match except in last match against New England. </li>
<li> Looking at attacking strength of Atlanta United they will score atleast 2 goals. Martinez will score at least one goal.</li>
</ul>
	<h3 align="center"><b> ATLANTA UNITED 3 : 1 SEATTLE SOUNDERS  </b></h3>
</div>
	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips.</p>
	<p class="prw">
		<ul > 
		<li> This match is only available on Halaplay. So it's important to take point system of Halaplay into consideration while making a fantasy team.</li>
		<li> In GK, Guzan will give you at least 2 points of passing accuracy.he has passing accuracy more than 80% in recent games with passes more than 30. You may go with Frie. As Atlanta looks more attacking, He might earn you points from saves. He will save 0.5 credits. </li>
		<li> Its better to go with more defenders from Atlanta side as there are high chances that they are going to score more than 2 goals. Parkhurst and Gonzalez are must pick. Pick at least one between Escobar and Ambrose. From the Seattle side, Kim and Marshall are best picks.</li>
		<li> In midfield, Almiron and Roldan are must picks. Barco is another best options. Lodeiro is the creative midfielder. He has at least 4 crosses in each game. His passing accuracy is also more than 80%. If he delivers an accurate cross, he might earn you point in the assist as well.</li>
		<li> Rodriguez, McCrary and Larentowicz are other considerable picks. Larentowicz is a good pick as can gather points from interceptions, blocks, tackles as well.</li>
		<li> Martinez and Bruin are must picks. Villalba is a good player. Has an assist and goal on his name in recent games.</li>
	</ul>
