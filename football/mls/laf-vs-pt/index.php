<p class="h">Prediction:</p>
<div class="pred">
<ul>
<li> Both teams are in great run of form. It is going to be an close affair.</li>
<li> LAFC is wins the race in terms of goal scoring record. Defensively there is not much difference in both teams.</li>
<li> Carlos Vela's introduction in the team increases the attacking strength of LAFC.</li>
<li> There are very less chances of any team keeping a clean sheet in this game.</li>
</ul>
	<h3 align="center"><b> Los Angeles FC 3 : 2 Portland Timbers  </b></h3>
</div>
	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection Tips.</p>
	<p class="prw">
		<ul > 
		<li> Balanced team with LAFC attack and Portland Timbers's defense.</li>
		<li> In attack from LAFC, try to pick Kaye, Vela, Blessing and Diomande. Kaye, Blessing and Diomande are consistently involved in goals. Vela is making his comeback to MLS. He is in fine form since start of the world cup. </li>
		<li> Valeri and Armenteros are must pick from Portland. In midfield pick any one from Chara and Blanco. Feilhaber is good pick. He has more than 50 passes consistently also very efficient in tackling too.</li>
		<li> Zimmerman and Ciman best options from LAFC at defense. Mabiala has scored in recent games for Portland. Pick anyone between Valentin and Powell but dont expect more than 2 points from them. They don't have great passing record</li>
		<li>  In GK, Atinella and Miller, both are good options. Miller will earn you more points than Atinella in terms of passing. As LAFC is more attaccking team, it gives more opportunities for Atinella to have more saves. </li>
	</ul>
