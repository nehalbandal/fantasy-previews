	<p class="prw">
		After thrilling opening game against Spain, Portugal will come in this contest with full of confidence. Cristiano Ronaldo has again deliver performance to remember at big stages.<br>
		Other than Ronaldo no was impressive in last game. Guedes miss couple of chances. B. Silva and Moutinho not upto the mark. Defensively they are still vulnarable.<br>
		Morocco come in this world cup in excellent form, Scoring in almost every game in last 8 matches that they have played. Against Iran they haven't played bad. They have almost 68% of possession. Its just that late own goal hurts them.<br>
		It will be facinating to see the approch of Morocco in this game. I think thats where the result of this game lies. Strong attcking mindset will be the key thing. <br>
		Iceland, Egypt, Japan, Tunisia have shown their mindsets in their opening games agains strong side. Will Morocco able to do same??

	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : l d d w d </dd> 
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Key players: Ronaldo, B. Silva. </b></li>
		<li>Fernando Santos might be tempted to replace A. Silva with Guedes.</li>
		<li> Only 1 clean sheet in last 7 games.</li>
		<li> Man City's creative mid-fielder B. Silva is going to be crucial for Portual. If he co-ordinate well with Cristiano, this pair can put up number of goals for portugal in this world cup</li>
		<li> Queresma, Mario and A. Silva are the most probable substitutes. </li>
	</ul>

	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : w d w w l </dd>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Key players: Kaabi, Ziyech, Belhanda, Benatia. </b></li>
		<li> Belhanda and Kabbi score 2 goals each in last 5 games.</li>
		<li> 2 clean sheets in last 5 games.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p class="h">Prediction:</p>
	<p> Looking at both sides defensive record in past few games, there is high chances of both team scoring.

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p> There is no much difference in defensive strength of both teams. In attack also there is difference of Cristiano Ronaldo. Team with more players in mid-field region will be the key in this game. Team tited towards Portugal will be the key. Prefer wingers in this game. </p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-3-3 OR 1-5-4-1</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li> Pick any one between Patricio and Mohamedi. Patricio is good keeper than Mohamedi. </li><br>
		<li> Benatia is must pick. Sassi and Hakimi are the other best option from Morocco. Guerreiro is must pick from Portugal.</li><br>
		<li> From morocco, try to pick at least 2 from Kaabi, Ziyech, Belhanda. All these players have score in recent games. If not goal, they can give you points in assist surely.</li><br>
		<li> Carvalho is excellent bargin pick at 8 credits. Pick any one between B. Silva and Moutinho. I think Silva will come good in this game.</li><br>
		<li> Ronaldo and Guedes are must picks. Can go for A. Silva if he starts.</li><br>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li>Ronaldo</li>
		<li>Guedes</li>
		<li>Kaabi</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li> Kabbi very good striker. Against these portugesse side, you can bet on him to score. </li>
	<li> Ziyech and Guerreiro are selected in less than 50% of Dream11 teams. Both are creative players. Excellent picks in GL. </li>
	</ul>
