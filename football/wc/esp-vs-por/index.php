		Well, the first heavyweight clash of the FIFA World Cup 2018 is about to happen. Euro 2016 champions Portugal are going to face 2010 World Cup winner Spain in the 1st match of Group B.<br> 
		Just three days before if you ask me who will be the favorite for this clash, my answer will Spain. Still, I'm in favor of Spain, but not much. I'm really concern about the effect of Julen Lopetegui's departure at the really crucial time.<br>
		Spain posses all the quality, skills, the experience of playing at big stages. All these attributes are enough to hold them as the title contender. Now it's all on individuals, how they are going to react to this situation.
		<br>
		Talking about Portugal, Now this is not a side which completely dependent on Cristiano Ronaldo. Head coach Fernando Santos has built the side with the mixture of experience and talented youth with likes of B. Silva, Guerreiro, A. Silva, a team that is hard to beat. <br>
		On paper, Spain is still better side. But all with this manager saga that they to deal with, It is interesting to see their approach going into this world cup.

	<p class="h">Team Guide</p>
	<p class="h">Spain</p>
	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : d d w d w  </dd> 
	<ul>
		<li> Unbeaten in last 20 game. Won 14 out of it.</li>
		<li> In 2 warm-up friendlies scored 2 goals and conceded 1.</li>
		<li> Haven't able to keep clean sheet in last 5 games prior to Tunsia.</li>
		<li> With likes of Iniesta, Silva, Busquets, Isco and Thiago in mid-field, they will going to create more chances at Portugal's goal post.</li>
		<li> Asensio, Vazquez, Iago Aspas have high probablity of coming from bench (if they won't start). This gives more attacking threat to the opponents as all have ability to score goal as well as creating chances. Koke can be introduce from the bench, depending on match situation.</li>
		<li> Defensively they are stonger than Portugal. Pique and Ramos can be the threat from the set-pieces.</li>
		<li> Its intresting to see to whom new manager is going to prefer lead the attack?? Costa or Moreno.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Portugal</p>
	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : w l d d w </dd>
	<ul>
		<li> Since Euro 2016, Lost only 2 in 29 matches.</li>
		<li> In 3 warm-up friendlies, Scored 5 and conceded 2.</li>
		<li> The World's Best Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't scored against Spain. Shockingly he has bad performance against top quality international sides. </li>
		<li> Other than Ronaldo, A. Silva is consistent scorer for portugal in WC Qualifications. Its upto Fernando Santos to select one between A. Silva and Guedes.</li>
		<li> Queresma is more likely to come up from bench. He has the ability to put crosses in box, Perfect set up for Cristiano to head the ball in to the net. B. Fernandes is another option for substitue. </li>
		<li> Man City's creative mid-fielder B. Silva is going to be crucial for Portual. If he co-ordinate well with Cristiano, this pair can put up number of goals for portugal in this world cup</li>
		<li> Experiance of Carvalho and J. Moutinho will hold the key against Spain.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Prediction:</p>
	<p> I think Spain has more attcking power than Portugal. Portugal have failed to scored against top quality sides.
		I am going with <b>2-0</b> in favour of <b>Spain</b>.
	</p>

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p> I am going to build my fantasy XI more in favour of Spain, Considering the performance of Portugal against top quality sides. On safer side, as Spain is going to have more possession, with their tic-tac style I will try to collect more points from passing. With so much creativity in Spain's mid-field it is hard to predict the pair who is gonna score.</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-5-1</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li><dd class="dds">Goalkeeper (GK):</dd> As I'm going with Spain to keep a clean sheet, it is wise to select De Gea. He is best in the world and can deny Ronaldo and his Co. from scoring goal. Patricio is the fine keeper, you can go for him.           </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Defenders (DEF):</dd> Pick 4 or 3 defenders from Spain. Ramos, Pique, and Alba are best options. Odriozola is the 4th defender from Spain. If you're also thinking that they will be going to have clean sheet then pick him too. From Portugal, Guerreiro is the fine player. He can create chances for forwards. Pepe, Fonte, and Cedric are the other options. Pick as per your choice.   </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Mid-fielders (MID):</dd> Here is the main business lies. Too much good options with high credits. Pick wisely. For me, Isco and D. Silva are the main picks. Busquets won't create chances but he can contribute hugely with passing and tackling. For me, he is must pick. We all know about Iniesta. I just think he won't be playing all 90 minutes. From Portugal side, at mid-field game is mostly revolve around Carvalho and J. Moutinho. Carvalho can give good points in passing and tackling. B. Silva is mostly playing high up on the pitch. He is a creative midfielder.     </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Forwards (ST):</dd> Even though he has bad performance against top quality sides, He is big match player. That's make Cristiano a must pick. Costa is more probably going to start. He is fine player. Rodrigo is another best option.         </li><br>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li>Ronaldo</li>
		<li>Isco</li>
		<li>D. Silva</li>
		<li>De Gea</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul> 
	<li> <b>Odriozola</b> is pick by less than 10% of people. He has scored goal warm-up friendlies against Swiss. Excellent pick if you are going with Spain keeping clean sheet.</li>
	<li> Go for Spain's substitutes. <b>Asensio, Vazquez</b> and <b>Rodrigo</b>. Even in less game time this player can contribute in goals. Pick atleast one.</li>
	<li> <b>Queresma</b> is fine attacking mid-fielder. Given good performances coming from bench. Worth a try in GL.</li>
	<li><b>Thiago</b>, another creative mid-fielder. He has been excellent goal scoring form in Bundesliga. Picked by less than 15% of people. Will be crucial pick in GL.</li>
	<li> <b>A. Silva, Rodrigo, Guedes, Iago</b> Aspas are picked by less than 30% of people. Fine young attackers. They are going to appear at some time in game. Anyone can score goal even in short period.</li>
	</ul>
