	<p class="prw">
		So, The Round of 16 will come to an end with match between England and Colombia. If England thought that they had avoided face off against Brazil and make their further path in this world cup bit easy then must ensure to put up strong show against Colombia to play quarter-final against team which is going to be less tougher than Brazillian side.<br><br>
		Gareth Southgate has described it as Englandâ€™s biggest game in a decade. England have played exceptional football in recent times and this increases their hopes as title contender. This will be 1st tough challenge infront of them since they have landed in Russia. Game against Belgium was meant to be real clash, but both sides opt to field almost "Team B".<br><br>
		After dissapointing start to their world cup campagin with lost to Japan by 1-2 Colombia manages to put up strong show in remaining matches where they beat poland by 3-0 and senegal by 1-0. Colombia is not a easy team to face. They are far improved side from the side that lost in quarter final against host in 2014. James Rodriguez's fitness will be real point concern for colombian side.<br><br>
		Both teams play attacking football. Englands attack looks more solid than Colombia. But their defense haven't been tested yet. This will going to be the another intresting, high intense tutsle. This world cup has given lots of surprises with underdog performing well against favourites. Are we are heading to another surprise??

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-5-1 OR 1-4-4-2</dd>
	<ul> 
		<li> Ospina will be better choice considering the English attack. Overall Ospina has slight edge over Pickford.
		</li>
		<li> In defense section its better to go with 2 defenders each from both the side. Tripper and Young are always in search of accurate cross that will lead to goal. Excellent wingers. Stones and Yerry Mina are threats from set pieces.  </li>
		<li> For safe side, D. Sanches and Walker are good picks. Both have more than 80 passes per game with pass accuracy more than 90%.</li>
		<li>Cudrado and Quintero are must picks from Colombian side.</li>
		<li> From England side there are lots of options in which Lindgard is must pick. Best to pick creative players in this match from England side.</li>
		<li> D. Alli is slightly risky option. Between him and Loftus-cheek any one can play. Alli is far better player than Loftus-cheek and should start this game. For safe picking go for Henderson.</li>
		<li> Harry Kane is must pick. Sterling is not performing upto the expectations but management still has faith in him.</li>
		<li> Falco is good player and good choice too but he hasn't had great outing except 1 goal against poland. Muriel was impressive in last game.</li>
		
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li> Kane</li>
		<li> Lindgard</li>
		<li> Falcao</li>
		<li> Sterling</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li>D. Alli could feature in this game. World class player. Can contribute in goals. Worth a try.</li>
	<li> Though sterling haven't been upto the mark, He can turn game on his head. He has every thing that makes him deadly attacker. Its just matter of time for all those things come in bunch. Excellent pick in GL.</li>
	<li> Walker and Young will not get lot of attention as the rest of English defense gets. Both are excellent players. Young with his arial ability and walker with his runs from wide of the pitch can create lots of chances. </li>
	<li> Rodriguez might appear as sub if team needed and if he is fit enough to play for some time. You can try him in one of your GL team.</li>
	<li> In Halaplay, You can pick anyone from Sanchez and Mina as Captain. As if England puts more attack on Colombian side this two can earn you good points from defending. They have good pass accuracy too.</li>
	</ul>
