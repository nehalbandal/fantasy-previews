	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul> 
	<li> Samedov is the only player from Russian side who has more crosses in the game averaging 4 per game. Creative midfielder is alwasy involve in Russian attack. Picked by less than 10%. You may include him in team for accumlating points from aerial ability. </li>
	<li> Perisic was impressive in last game. He plays simillar role as Samedov does for russians. He will look to create chances for Mandzukic from left wing. </li>
	<li> Kutepov and Ignashevich will best options for captain in Halaplay and Playerzpot.</li>
