	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<p class="prw">
			Not many people will have both Croatia and England in their list of top four at start of the world cup. Now both these teams are up and ready to face each other in 2nd semifinal. Both teams well and truly deserve to be in the semifinal, but now only one can able to play final on sunday in Moscow.
		<br><br>
		Croatia are unbeaten in the tournament till now. But they have forced to play all 120 minutes in each game of knockouts before winning in penalty shootout. They had to work really hard to get win in last two games. Not only physically but they had drained mentally due to the mental pressure of the shootouts. 
		<br><br> 
		On other hand, England had easy game against Sweden where they beat them by 2-0. Compared to Croatia, England's players are fresh and mentally relaxed. England had a one loss in this tournament that was against Belgium where they fielded almost "B Side". Otherwise England's performance is got better in each match. Overall they are stronger team in comparison with Croatia.
		<br><br>
		Croatia's main strength lies in midfield where Luka Modric and Ivan Rakatic controls the pace of their attack.
		Mandzukic has also worked harder. Croatia will be looking for more better performances from Perisic and Rebic.
		With Vrsaljko out due to injury, Corluka will be the likely replacement for him.
		<br><br>
		Croatia have conceded 2 of their 4 goals from set-pieces whereas England has scored 5 goals from set-pieces till now. England certainly looks threatening from set-pieces as they have strong and tall players compared to croatians. England looks like a complete team at the moment with strong attack led by captain Harry Kane, stable midfield with excellent wingers in likes of Young and tripper and solid defensive structure.
		<br><br>
		England will be starting this game as favourite not only because they looks much better at every department but another thing in their favor is the workload they had in last two games compared to Croatian side. But as this world cup has given us few examples of what determinantion, self belief and hunger to win can do a miracles.
		Can Croatia overcome their fatigue and able pulled of another miracle??

	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : w w w w w  </dd> 
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Key players: Modric, Rakitic, Mandzukic</b></li>
		<li> Corluka will be the likely replacement for Vrsaljko.</li>
		<li> Danijel Subasic is expected to recover from a hamstring injury that he suffered against Russia.</li>
		<li> Brozović might start inplace of last match goal scorer Kramaric, only to allow Luka Modric play more at upfront.</li>
		<li> Kovacic will again start from bench. He is one of three expected substituiton.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">England</p>
	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : w w l w w </dd>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Key players: Kane, Lingard, Sterling</b></li>
		<li> There no fresh injury concerns for England. Henderson has picked a slight harmstring injury but he is expected to recover in time.</li>
		<li> Gareth Southgate won't be looking for any changes in the starting XI.</li>
		<li> Rashford and Dier are more likely subs from English side. Vardy is remains a doubt.</li>

	<p class="h">Prediction:</p>
	<p><b> Croatia 1 : 2 England </b></p>

<br>


	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-4-2 OR 1-3-5-2</dd>
	<ul> 
		<li> It will be better to go with 6-7 fresh England player and rest are from croatians. Remember, fatigue of croatians will be playing major part in this game.</li>
		<li> Pickford is absoultely brilliant in last few games. Subasic has played last 30 minutes of game against Russia with injury. This injury will going to have effect on his movement infront of the post.</li>
		<li> Looking at both teams record on set-pieces, Stones and Maguire are look like must pick. Vida and Lovern are best picks from Croatian side. </li>
		<li> Modric, Rakatic, and Lindgard are must picks. Very crucial players as they gives good points in accurate passing, tackling and they are always invlove in the attack.</li>
		<li> Dele Alli has shown in last match what he is capable off. Excellent creative midfielder player. Henderson will give you points in passing and tackling. Excellent pick at 8 creadits.</li>
		<li> Pick anyone between Young and Tripper. These wingers are always look to create aerial threats on opposition goalpost. They are also set-piece takers. </li>
		<li> Kane and Mandzukic are the best options upfront. Stering is still find his form. He may able to put good performance against fatigued croatians</li>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li> Kane</li>
		<li> Modric</li>
		<li> Lingard</li>
		<li> Mandzukic</li>
		<li> Stones</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li> Sterling and Alli are still not included in many of teams. Both are attacking players. Worth to try them in GL. They can put up a stong show upfront with Kane.</li>
	<li> Tripper and Young, one of them has to be in the team. Set-piece specialist. May earn you points in assist, and if Engand able to kept a clean sheet they will boost up your ranking at the end of the game. </li>
	</ul>
