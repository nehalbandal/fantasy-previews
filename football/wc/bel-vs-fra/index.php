	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<p class="prw">
		FIFA world cup has now reach its penultimate stage and we now have our four finalist. Now we may look towards this as European championship as all semi-finalist are from Europe. France, Belgium, England, and Croatia.
		<br><br>
		Both teams are unbeatan uptill this stage. But now one has to make a way for other to go ahead. Except match against Argentina, France haven't able to put comprehensive performance that was expected from their side since start of the world cup. They are far away from their best in group stages. But in knouckout they seems to picked up their form.
		<br><br> 
		Main concern for Didier Deschamp is that they haven't able to put a strong show at back line. They had kept 2 clean sheets but they weren't look solid at back. Game against Uruguay can turn on other side if South Americans able count on chances that they got.<br><br>
		France defense is now going to face the best attack of this world cup. Belgium's attack comprises of pace, creativity, smartness. When they attack, we get a sense that they might score or atleast they can have shot on target. Even though Hazard and Lukaku are not scoring goals since last 3 games but you just cannot neglect their contribution in knockouts. With change of role for Kevin De Bruyne, Belgium is not scoring goal in regular time is almost unimaginable.<br><br>
		Compared to France defense, Belgium defense looks more solid and discipline. They have experianced player at back in likes of Kompany, Alderweireld, Vertonghen. Courtois was exceptional in a game against Brazil. He was the main key in Belgium's win over Brazil. There is not much difference in midfield strength of both the teams.
		Its the back line who is going to decides the result of this match.

<p class="h">Probable Starting Line-Ups</p>
	<p><b>Belgium:</b>Courtois (GK); Alderweireld, Kompany, Vertonghen; Chadli, Carrasco, Witsel, Fellaini; De Bruyne, Hazard, Lukaku </p>
	<br>
	<p><b>France:</b>Lloris (GK); Pavard, Varane, Umtiti, Hernandez; Pogba, Kante, Matuidi; Griezmann, Mbappe, Giroud </p>

	<p class="h">Team Guide</p>
	<p class="h">Belgium</p>
	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : w w w w w </dd> 
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Key players: De Bruyne, Hazard, Lukaku, Kompany</b></li>
		<li> De Bruyne is expected to play same role as he played against Brazil. Play in center of the attack.</li>
		<li> Thomas Meunier is suspended, Chadli likely to move over to the right and Yannick Carrasco to return to the left with change in formation to 3-4-3.</li>
		<li> Roberto Martinez may go for extra defender to increase defensive solidity. Vermaelen and Boyata may be in the contention for this place.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">France</p>
	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : w w d w w</dd>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Key players: Griezmann, Mbappe, Varane</b></li>
		<li> Blaise Matuidi returns from suspension and could replace Corentin Tolisso.</li>
		<li> France won't look like to make any more changes in final XI.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p class="h">Prediction:</p>
	<p><b> Belgium 2 : 1 France  </b></p>

<br>


	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-3-4-3 OR 1-4-4-2</dd>
	<ul> 
		<li> Top quality players with huge credit points. Its nearly impossible take all of them in a fantasy team.</li>
		<li> Courtois is better pick as he his high on his confidance that he gain in last games and has faced tougher challenges tha Lloris in this WC.</li>
		<li> Two center back from Belgium and one or two wingers from France will be the best statergy. Kompany is the best defender from both sides. Varane is also looks solid at back. Pavard is impressive in this tournament with his play on right wing.</li>
		<li> Hazard is mandatory pick. De Bruyne's change of role allows him to play him more freely and which makes him real threat in front of France goalpost. Paul Pogba haven't contributed largely in France goal scoring record in this WC. He is world class midfielder, goal or assist from him is never far awasy from him. </li>
		<li> Kante and Witsel are another best picks. Both will earn you points in passing and tackling. You may go for Fellani or Chadli in middle. Fellani will be good choice.</li>
		<li> If you able manage credits go for Lukaku, Grizmann, and Mbappe. Giroud is excellent. He will alwasy there in the France attack. He is not a bad choice to go.</li>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li>Mbappe</li>
		<li>Griezmann</li>
		<li>Lukaku</li>
		<li>Hazard</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li> Giroud has been picked in less than 20% of the teams. He is brilliant in front of goals. This will be best pick in GL.</li>
	<li> Kompany has been picked in less than 20% of the teams. He is the best defenders among both teams. Solid at back. One of threats on set-pieces. In Halaplay and PlayerzPot he is good candidate for a captain.</li>
	</ul>
