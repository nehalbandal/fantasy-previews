		<li> Chadli or Fellani can get start in place of Mertens or Corrasco.</li>
		<li> Meunier, Vertonghen, Tielemans, Dendoncker and De Bruyne are one booking away from a suspension.</li>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li> Marcelo is back in team. Fernandinho is also set to start this game. Both are creative player. Worth to try in GL.</li>
	<li> Gabriel Jesus is not in a form in this tournament, but he is a excellent striker. If he get any opportunity to score a goal, he will make sure turned it into goal. </li>
	<li> Being a forward Mertens haven't involve considerably in goal scoring chart. But he is more looking to create chances. His aerial balls in box are excellent. He might earn you points in assist. </li>
	</ul>
