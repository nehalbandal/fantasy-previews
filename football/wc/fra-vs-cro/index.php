They haven't played that kind of attacking football they are known for before the start of the competition, but they are playing smart football. They are looking to counter attack the oppositions. They slowly build up their attack as the game progresses. France won't look as totally attacking team but they are quiet efficient when they attack. That's the key thing for the France. 
		<br><br>
		On other side, Croatia's main strength lies in midfield. Luka Modric is the key player for croatians thorughout this tournament and they will be best from him in final. Croatia has 41 attempts of crosses in a game against england of which one results in a goal. They will going to use this ploy in the final to.

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li> Mbappe will be crucial pick in this game as he is up against Strinic who was not able to handle pace of Sterling in last game. Mbappe is far better in form than sterling. He has great chance of putting his name on scoresheet.</li>
	<li> Giroud has missed lot of chances in last game but he one of the vital cog in France attack. If he able improve his performance, there his high chances of him to be on scoresheet.</li>
	<li> Vida has great semifinal. He has earn lot of points with his excellent defending. He will be good choice as a captain in Halaplay and Playerzpot.</li>
	<li> Matuadi and Brozovic are great picks at 8.5 credits in Halaplay.</li>
	</ul>
