	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p> Japan is not a attacking side. They will sit deep and try to defend. But with quality of attack that colombia has it will be difficult to restrict them from score goals. 7 Colombian & 4 Japaneese is way to build your team. 95% chances of clean sheet for Colombia.</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-3-5-2</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li> Roriguez, Falcao are must at front.</li><br>
		<li> For safe going, 4 defenders and a GK from Colombian side.</li><br>
		<li> It is difficult to predict who gonna assist other than Rodriguez in this colombian side. Cudrado is good experiance player. He will player in mid you can bank on.</li><br>
		<li> Its better to pick 4 Japaneese from midfield and forward. Kagawa is must pick along with Yamaguchi and Honda.</li><br>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li>Roriguez</li>
		<li>Falcao</li>
		<li>D. Sanchez</li>
