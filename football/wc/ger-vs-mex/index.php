	<p class="prw"> 
		Germany will start their title defence against Mexico in Group F fixture. Germany are always the title contenders whichever tournament they played.<br>
		Current form of German side is not very exciting. They ended their five game winless streak against Saudi arabia in warm up friendlies. Even though they are in bad form, They posses all the attributes to do well in the world cup.<br>
		German side will be boosted by the presense of great midfielder Marco Reus. It will be intresting to watch Thomas muller in this world cup. Whether he will able continues his great form in world cup or not??<br>
		Mexico are 2nd favourite to go pass through this group. Even though this Mexico team posses big names like Germans but they have the players how can put up strong show against any nation.<br>
		Now, here is the trivia, Since 1998, the world cup winning nation is failed to go pass through group stages in next world cup only exception is Brazil (2002 WC Winners). Happen with France, Italy, and Spain. Will Germany able to avoid this tabbo???

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p>Don't know anout the clean sheet, but Germany will going to enjoy most of the ball. I will look take more points from the passing of German side. 7 Germany & 4 Mexican way to go.</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-4-2</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li><dd class="dds">Goalkeeper (GK):</dd> We all know how good Neuer is. But Ochoa is equally good. Has given memorable performance in Rio. Still capable to replicate that in Russia.          </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Defenders (DEF):</dd> Kimmich with is creativity & Hummels with his solidity at back and one of the threat in set pieces, makes them nearly must pick. Boateng is another good option. There is confusion in the 4th defender from Germany. Salcedo, Moreno and Ayala are good options from Mexico.  </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Mid-fielders (MID):</dd> Lots of options. I think Kroos and Reus are must from Germany. Pick any one from Ozil & Khedira. Khedira is fine passer of the ball. G Dos Santos is must from Mexico. J. Dos Santos is another considerable option. </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Forwards (ST):</dd> Muller & Werner are must picks. Werner is in fine form this season. Hernandez is best option from Mexican side. Lozano and Vela are in excellent touch in last few games. Both are creative players. Won't dissapoint if you pick one of them instead of Hernandez.         </li><br>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li> Muller</li>
		<li> Werner</li>
		<li> Kroos</li>
		<li> G. Dos Santos</li>
		<li> Hummels</li>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li> Werner has been picked by less than 50% of people. Really crucial pick.</li>
	<li> Ochoa is really fine GK, picked by less than 40% of people. He can stop Germans from scoring goals. </li>
	<li> Khedira is really fine player. He can collect points in passing, tackling and may be in assist. Really smart pick. </li>
	<li> Goretzka & Gundogan has chances of comming from bench. Both are creative mid-fielders. Worth a try in GL. Prefer Gundogan.</li>
	</ul>
		

	<h3 class="atb">All the best</h3><br>
