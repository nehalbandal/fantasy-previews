	<p class="prw">
		The World Cup third place match is set to played between sides a who don't given a clear-cut chance at the start of the world cup. As tournament progress bets on both the sides started to rise as one of the title contenders. Now both teams will battel hard for bronze medal place.
		<br><br>
		This side has faced each other in group stage match which was thought as the toughest challange for both the teams, but both the manager had different ideas and they fielded almost a "B Side". Now its chance for everyone to see both teams at their full potential.
		<br><br>
		Belgium's attacking football is treat to watch and it is also much appricieated all over the world. With strong attacking prowess consisting of top premier league player such as De Bruyne, Hazard, and Lukaku Belgium's attack still consider as one of the best attacking team of this year's tournament. Belgium have scored 14 goals most by any team in this tournament. Romelo Lukaku is the leading scorer for Red Devils with 4, he will look to challenge tournament's leading scorer Harry Kane who has scored 6 goals till now.
		<br><br>
		After Belgium it is the England who has scored more goals in the competiton (13) out of which 6 goal are from set-pieces. England haven't look as team that can produce attacking threat at greater extent as Belgium does. They are threatening side from set-pieces as they have won the most aerial duels than any other team in the competiton. England need to improve their midfield play. They haven't able to kept possession in midfield thoughout this tournament. With Tripper and Young playing on flanks, it is the duty of Henderson, Lindgard and Alli to have ball posession in midfield. If they want stand strong against Belgium they have to be strong in midfield.
		<br><br>
		Goals.. Thats what everyone can expect in this match. Both teams are capable of doing that. With attcking prowess both team posses, both team scoring goal his high possiblity. This Belgium team is thought as the "Golden Genration" of Belgium football, Now they will atleast try to achieve the feat that no other Belgium side has achieved in past or England will try to end their "It's Comming Home" campaign with Bronze medal.

<br>


	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-4-2</dd>
	<ul> 
		<li> Team with Belgium attack and English defense will be the wise stratergy.</li>
		<li> Stones and Maguire are best pick from english side as both are main threats at the set-pieces. Simillarly Kompany is the main target from Belgium side.</li>
		<li> Hazard is must pick. Pick any one between Alli and Lindgard. These creative midfielder will earn you points from assists or may even from goals. Don't expect more than 2 points from them in passing. </li>
		<li> De Bruyne will be best pick if he had given role at upfornt. He playing at deep won't earn you good points. Axel witsel is the best bargain pick. He will earn you good points from passing and tackling.</li>
		<li> Lukaku and Kane are must picks upfront. Don't see any other better option at up front.</li>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li> Kane</li>
		<li> Hazard</li>
		<li> Lukaku</li>
		<li> Maguire</li>
	</ul>
