	So, The wait for the world's biggest party is about to over in Russia. Russia will host the 21st FIFA World Cup.
	In 1st game, Host Russia will take on Saudi Arabia. Both lowest ranked team in this world cup. Their chances of getting through to the group stage are less. But this will be big oppourtunity for both team to win.
	<br> Russia will have the home advantage but their recent performances won't excite us to held them as strong team to win this contest. On other side, even though Saudi not able manage win in warm-up friendlies but they can get huge confidence from their performances against France and Germany.
	<br> There is history that no host nation has lost on their opening game. Well, we have look now tha will history contiues or Saudi Arabia "The Green Falcons" will change it.

	<p class="h">Prediction: </p>
	<dd class="dds">Both teams are defensively weak. Less chances of goalless draw. I think Saudi has better side compare to Russia, they have shown in game against Germany. Thing is in favour of Russia is HOME SUPPORT. I'm going with draw at 1-1.

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-4-2</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li><dd class="dds">Goalkeeper (GK):</dd> Akinfeev is best option. He is experianced and given good performances while playing for CSKA Moscow. Al Maiouf was excellent against germany. He made total 7 saves in that game.  </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Defenders (DEF):</dd> Both teams are not defensively strong. But still you can collect points from passing as both teams will look to settle on ball rather than being in attacking position. Ignashevich is nearly must pick. He is main defender of Russia. Other good options are Kudryashov, Kutepov, Fernandes, Al-Shahrani and Osama Hawsawi.  </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Mid-fielders (MID):</dd> Samedov and Al-Shehri are must pick. Both has ability to assist and when time comes they can score the goal. Both are impressive in warm-up friendlies. Al-Dawsari is play-maker for Saudi Arabia. He can create chances for Al-Sahlawi. Otayf is another good pick. He plays in the middle of pitch and can give us good points in passing. Golovin is fine attacking midfielder. He is in fine form in this season. Winger Al-Muwallad is another intresting pick. He is really fine talent. Will be handy for Russia's defence. Other considerable picks are Dzagoev, Al-Jasssim.  </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Forwards (ST):</dd> Smolov and Al-Sahlawi must pick. Both are experianced and had fine record infront of goal.   </li><br>
	</ul>
