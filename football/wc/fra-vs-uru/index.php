	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<p class="prw">
		FIFA World cup 2018 Russia is now reach up to Quarter-final stage. Teams are  now 2 more steps away from making their dream come true. In 1st match of quarter-final France is up against Uruguay.<br><br>
		France have finally played upto their full potential in last game against Argentina. That game saw total of seven goals. Yet again teenager Kylin Mbappe was impressive. His attacking run, the finish was top class. He bagged 2 goals in that game taking his goal tally of this world cup to 3.<br><br>
		France need more from Grizmann and Pogba. Grizmann has scored 2 goals so far but all from penalty spot. France have solid defense but somehow they still a goal. France are now up against Uruguay, Probably tournaments best defensive team.
		<br><br>
		It won't be suprised to see Uruguay spending more time of the game in their defensive area. But they certainly not lack in attacking department too. Uruguay got huge blow in last match when they saw their top scorer is limping of ground. He will miss quarter-final if he is not able to recover from knock. Still there is no confirm news about his injury but if it happened to be a serious one Uruguay will have big decision to make in selection of replacement of Cavani. Stuani is ahead in this race.<br><br>
		It is the clash between strongest attack verseus strongest defense. With likes of Mbappe, Grizmann and Dembele going head to head against Godin, Laxalt and Gimenez, It will definately going to be the thriller of contest.

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-3-3</dd>
	<ul> 
		<li> With France looking as team who are going to play more attacking football its better to go with more players from France at front with solid Uruguayian defense. </li>
		<li> Godin and Varane are must pick at defense. Its better choice to pick Muslera as Keeper. He will have more chances of save rather than Lloris. </li>
		<li> Laxalt was very good in game against Portugal. He is must pick in Halaplay and PlayerzPot. You may go for Gimenez and Pavard as fullback of your team.</li>
		<li> Kante, Dembele and Pogba are best choices along with Bentancur and Vecino. Torreira is another good option available. </li>
		<li> Suarez, Mbappe and Grizmann are straight-forward picks. Considering Grizmann's form may go for extra midfielder by dropping him.</li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li> Mbappe</li>
		<li> Griezmann</li>
		<li> Suarez</li>
		<li> Godin (in Halaplay & Playerzpot)</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul> 
	<li> Dembele has been selected in less than 20% of teams. Excellent midfielder. In co-ordination with Mbappe and Grizmann he will create more opportunities of goals. Prior to World cup he has been in great form.</li>
	<li> Giroud has been picked in less than 25% of teams. He will be very dangerous on crosses coming in box. France wingers will look to exploit his areal ability in this game.</li>
	<li> Rodriguez and Fakir cames as a sub. Both are creative player. Can score goal if they get any kind of opportunities.</li>
	</ul>
		

	<h3 class="atb">All the best</h3><br>
