		England enters in this tournament to prove their worth after the humiliation they faced in Euro 2016.<br>
		England will face Tunisia in their 1st Group G fixture against Tunisia. It will be tricky game for England. Tunisia is not side that can be dealt easily.<br>
		Tunisia is well organised team. They had 3 tough warm up friendly games. They will look to exploit the weak england defence.<br>
		England's attack led by Kane with Alli and Sterling on sides is attack to be fear off. England have lots of options in attack. For them its all based on the co-ordination between front three.<br>
		The talent that england possess, There is high hope on them to do well in this world cup.

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p> Since its 1st game for both teams, both tems will be tentitive to go forward. Its better to pick wingers in this game as both teams will be likely to put crosess in box and scored goals.</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-4-2</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li> Mathlouthi is good choice. Can earn points from save more than Pickford.</li><br>
		<li> Walker, Young and Rose are nearly must picks. They will put crosess in box.</li><br>
		<li> Sterling, Kane, Alli are must picks. Even though they are not scoring in recent games, You can't write off these three.</li><br>
		<li> Lindgard is another best option from england side.</li><br>
		<li> From Tunisia, Khazri, Sassi, and Badri are must picks.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li> Rashford and Vardy has high chances of coming from bench. World class strikers, Scored in recent games. Worth a try.</li>
	<li>Lindgard is taken by less than 50% of people. Talented midfielder can score and create goals.</li>
	</ul>
