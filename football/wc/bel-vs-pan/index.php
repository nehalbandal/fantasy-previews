	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p> Their is huge gap in terms of class in both teams. Belgium will continously look to attack. 7 Belgium & 4 Panama players is must combination. Don't pick any defender from panama.</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-3-5-2</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li> Its better to go with Courtois and 3 other defenders from Belgium side. There is still doubt on Company's fitness.</li><br>
		<li> Lukaku, Hazard, De Bruyne are must pick.</li><br>
		<li> You can go for Carrasco or Witsel. Witsel is best option. Good points in passing and tackles are gaurantee.</li><br>
		<li> Its better to pick 4 panama players from mid-field. Can give you points from passing. You can go for 1 striker from Panama.</li><br>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li>Lukaku</li>
		<li>Hazard</li>
		<li>De Bruyne</li>
		<li>Meunier</li>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li> Mertens is in poor from lately. But excellent striker. Can score goal against this Panama side.</li>
		<li> Batshuayi is more likely to come up from bench. Striker in excellent form. Worth a try in GL.</li>
		<li> Fellaini is also likely to come up from bench. Excellent player. Has ability to create goals. Threatening on set-pieces.</li>
	</ul>
