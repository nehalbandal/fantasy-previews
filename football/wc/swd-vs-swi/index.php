	<p class="h">Match Preview</p>
	<p class="prw">Probably this will be the first game in Round of 16 where no one bet on any of this two as favorites or even as dark horse. Despite of this both teams have impressed alot by their performances in group stages. Both are well organized and balance teams.<br><br>
	Sweden, After heart breaking defeat against Germany in which they conceded very late goal, they came out strongly and top their group by thrashing Mexico 3-0 in their must win game. Sweden are rock solid at defense which is led by Grandqvist. Since they arrived in Russia they failed only once to keep a clean sheet. They lack in attacking department. It was defender who scored a goal for them in group stages. <br><br>
	Switzerland enters in this match without their key defenders Schar and Lichtsteiner, who are suspended for this match. This will weaken the Swiss defense. This Swiss side has very tough character, they have shown the ability to come from behind. Xhaka and Shaqiri are going to be bigger threat for swedish defense.<br><br>
	There is not much of a difference in both the teams. Due to two suspensions, Swiss defense has weaken. But this swedish side is not that much attacking. Looking at both teams structure and style of play it is difficult to get result in 90 minutes.

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-5-1 OR 1-4-4-2</dd>
	<ul> 
		<li>There is not much of difference between two keepers. Sommer will have just edge over Olsen in Dream11 and PlayerzPot as he averages more than 30 passes per game with pass accuracy around 65%. </li>
		<li>Its better to pick 2 defenders each from both sides. Grandqvist and Akanji are must pick. Rodrigez will be fine option. This right winger is alwasy looking for putting up crosses in a box.</li>
		<li>Djourou will be playing as fullback in place of schar. Very good pick as he is going to involve more in the game. More passes, clearances, interceptions and blocks. Player suited for any kind of team. </li>
		<li>Xhaka, Shaqiri, Ekdal and Claesson are very crucial picks. Try to pick all of them. Behrami is another good pick as he averages 50 passes per game with pass accuracy of 90%.</li>
		<li>Embolo is excellent player. Always involve in attack. Toivonen and Berg are other two options. Berg is more suitable option than Toivonen. </li>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li>Grandqvist</li>
		<li>Shaqiri</li>
		<li>Xhaka</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li>Rodriguez hasn't been in his prime touch, thouh he is man with experiance. Winger who always in search of goals. In halaplay he can earn you points in crossing field. Also has passing accuracy above 80%. </li>
	<li>Forsberg has quiet tournament compared to his form before the start of world cup. He will be the key man in swedish attack.</li>
	</ul>
