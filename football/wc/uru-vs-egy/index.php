	<p class="prw">
		Since 26th May large part of the world is praying Moh Salah. The man has become larger than life figure in only one season with Liverpool. Scored 44 goals in this season. Most by Liverpool player this season.<br>
		Other than Salah story, This contest is nothing to offer any excitement. There is huge difference in both the sides. Egypt's progress in this world cup is largely based on Salah's performance. While Uruguay have bunch of quality players led with two prolofic strikes Suarez and Cavani. Both are in excellent form.<br>
		It will be huge ask for Egypt's defence to stop this two strikers. Salah running down the wing is the only and big concern for Uruguay. If they able to keep salah quiet, They will get through this match easily

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p> I'm going to build this team as per my prediction. 7 Uruguay and 4 Egyptians. It will be better to prefer Uruguay's defenders than mid-fielders. Clean sheet is on the card. Salah is not going to have player like Firminho, Sadio Mane around him here.</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-4-2</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li><dd class="dds">Goalkeeper (GK):</dd> Muslera is straight forward choice. You can pick El-Hadary if your going to pick more mid-fielder from Uruguay.          </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Defenders (DEF):</dd> Godin, Gimenez are must pick. Caceres has high chances to start the game. Any one from Pereira and Varela is going to start. Prefer Varela. From Egypt, Hegazi is best option. Gabr and Fathi are another considerable options. </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Mid-fielders (MID):</dd> From Egypt, Salah and Elneny are best picks. Bentancur and Arrascaeta are creative mid-filders. Pick atleast one of them. Their link-up play with strikers is vital in this game. I'm not sure about other two starter in mid-field. C. Rodriguez and Torreira has shown good form in recent games.    </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Forwards (ST):</dd> Suarez and Cavani are must pick. Won't able to see any other better options.        </li><br>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li>Cavani</li>
		<li>Suarez</li>
		<li>Salah</li>
		<li>Godin</li>
		<li>Bentancur</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul> 
	<li> Bentancur is taken by less than 20% of people. He is Good creative mid-fielder.</li>
	<li> For me, there is confusion between Varela and Pereira. One is surely going to play. Clean sheet more likely for Uruguay. So if you go with 4 defender plus GK, and C & VC from defence, That team definately gonna rank high.</li>
	<li> We all know about Moh Salah. He can score at any time. He will be giving his everything in this world cup. Taken by less than 60% of people. Worth a try in GL. </li>
	</ul>
