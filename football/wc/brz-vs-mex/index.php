		In 5th match of Round of 16 Favourites Brazil will face Mexico. Brazil didn't start world cup very well, they force to draw 1-1 against Swiss side. But after that they came in good shape and end up group stage as table topper by beating Costa Rica(2-0) and Serbia(2-0). Defense led by veteran Thiago Silva along with Miranda was rock solid in group stages. Coutinho and Neymar are core of the Brazillian attack which well supported by Poulinho and willan.<br><br>
		Mexico, On other hand after impressive start to the world cup by beating world champions Germany by 1-0 and Japan by 2-1 they were hammered by Sweden in last match by 3-0. In that match they are in the position to go out of the world cup if Germany had scored at least 1 goal. Eventually they finished 2nd in group.<br><br>
		This Brzillian side haven't forget the brilliance Ochoa in last world cup. Neymar and Co. will again have tough task of dealing with him. Mexico will be bank on counter attack, which they have done well in the group stages.
