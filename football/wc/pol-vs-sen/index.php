		In Group H fixture, Poland and Senegal are facing each other first time at international level.<br>
		Both team possess player who can change game single handedly. Robert Lewandowski and Sadio Mane.<br>
		Senegal have quiet of quality players other than Mane. Balde, Sow and at back Koulibaly. This in-form Senegal side is going to be quiet challange to other teams.<br>
		Poland side is defensively weak, and with Kamil Glik out injured its weaken defence further more. Their world cup campaign is largely depends on performance of Lewandowski and Szczesny.<br>
		With quality attacking players in both side, this will not going to be dead rubber contest. Goals will come.

	<p class="h">Team Guide</p>
	<p class="h">Poland</p>
	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : l l w d w  </dd> 
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Key players: Lewandowski, Zielinski</b></li>
		<li> In 2 warm-up friendlies, scored 6 and conceded 2.</li>
		<li> Only 1 clean sheets in last 5 games.</li>
		<li> Lewandowski has scored 4 in last 3 games, while Zielinski has scored 2 in last 3.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Senegal</p>
	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : d d d l w </dd>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Key players: Mane, Balde. </b></li>
		<li> In 3 warm-up friendlies, scored 3 and conceded 2.</li>
		<li> 3 clean sheets in last 5 games.</li>
		<li> Mane haven't scored goal in last 8 games.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p class="h">Prediction:</p>
	<p> With weak defense, there is ensureity about gaols from both sides. But Senegal's forward are not performing upto their level. That's force me to go for Poland with 1-0. </p>

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p> Both teams have quality attack and weak defense. There is high chances of goals from both sides. Side in bit favour of Poland is way to go.</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-5-1</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li> Szczesny is best pick in GK. Can go for N’Diaye and hope to collect points from saves. </li><br>
		<li> Piszczek and Koulibaly are must pick in defense. Pick 1 or 2 more defender from Polish side.</li><br>
		<li> Mane and Zielinski are must picks. Grosicki is also excellent pick. Really fine player. Can expect points from assisst or goals.</li><br>
		<li> From senegal Balde and Kouyate are another good options.</li><br>
		<li> Lewandowski is must pick. Sow is another best option in forward.</li>
