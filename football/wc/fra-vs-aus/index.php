	<p class="prw">
		France, One of the title contenders are going to start their world cup campagin against team which was the last team to qualify for world cup in Russia.<br>
		The thing that puts France in strong position of title is their solidity at every department. They have players at every position on the pitch who are in their prime form. Their attack is one of the best in this world cup.
		<br> 
		Young France side will be up against side which has kept the faith in experiance player. They have quiet a few players who are at Rio 2014. They have prettey less chances of going past this group stage.<br>
		It is straight forward draw. It's just how many goals we are going to see in this game is the really intresting point.

	<p class="h">Team Guide</p>
	<p class="h">France</p>
	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : l w w w d </dd> 
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Key players: Griezmann, Dembele, Mbappe, Pogba.</b></li>
		<li> In 3 warm-up friendlies, Scored 6 and conceded 2.</li>
		<li> Kept only one clean sheet in last 6 games.</li>
		<li> Mbappe has scored 3 goals and 2 assists in last 5 games.</li>
		<li> In last 14 games, scored at least 3 goals per game on 9 occasions.</li>
		<li> They may include Matudi inplace of Tolisso.</li>
		<li> Giroud, Fekir, and Lemar has high chances of coming from bench. One of them may start in place of Tolisso or Dembele. Less chances though.</li>
		
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Australia</p>
	<dd class="dds">Last 5 games : w l d w w</dd>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Key players: Mooy, Nabbout, Rogic, Jedinak. </b></li>
		<li> In 2 warm-up friendlies, Scored 6 and conceded 1.</li>
		<li> 3 clean sheets in last 5 games.</li>
		<li> Attacking side is very inexperianced at this level.</li>
		<li> Tim Cahil is most probably is going to start from bench.</li>
		<li> Midfielder Aron Mooy is their key main. Australia's game is mostly revolving around him.</li>
		<li> Irvine may start inplace of Rogic.</li>
		
	</ul>
	
	<p class="h">Prediction:</p>
	<p> I don't see any upset on the card. With the attack France posses I think there in another treble on the card.
		<b> France 3-0.</b></p>

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p> For me, this game is going to full of goals. I expect France can score minimum 3. It's nearly mandatory to go with 7 France and 4 Aussies. 90% chances of clean sheet. Also France is going to more of the ball.</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-4-2</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li><dd class="dds">Goalkeeper (GK):</dd> If you're going with france clean sheet, go for Lorris with 4 other ddefenders. Ryan is good goalkeeper. Can give you 2 points with saves. On his day he can give more.   </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Defenders (DEF):</dd> It's on you now 4 or 3 France defenders. I think Varane, Mendy & Umtiti are must picks. Pavard is creative player. Playing on wings can put crosses in box & create chances. I won't suggest to for any Aussie defender. But if you want, Milligan and Sainsbury are good optios.   </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Mid-fielders (MID):</dd> Dembele is must. Playing from France he has been outstanding. Pogba top quality creative midfielder is another crucial pick. Not in his prime form though. But we all know how excellent this player is. From Asussie side Mooy is must pick.Lecik has scored in warm-up friendlies. Rogic and Jedinak are another considerable options.  </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Forwards (ST):</dd>  Griezmann and Mbappe are must picks. From Aussie side, you can go for Nabbout. Has high chances to start the game.        </li><br>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li> With so much attacking talent it is difficult to predict who is gonna score and who gonna assist from France.</li>
		<li> For safe side you can choose C & VC from France defence. </li>
		<li> Mbappe</li>
		<li> Griezmann</li>
		<li> Dembele</li>
		<li> Pogba</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul> 
	<li> There is not going to have much focus on likes of Kante, Tolisso, Matudi and pavard. This players are going to play at back and remember this players ocassionally looking for creating chances. This players can give you points in Tackling, Passing and on their day with assists or may be a goal to good. Its worth to try one or two this player.  </li>
	<li> "Super Sub" Oliver Giroud is taken by less than 25% of people. He has knack of sccoring goals coming from bench.</li>
	</ul>
		

	<h3 class="atb">All the best</h3><br>
