	<p class="prw">
		Belgium entered in Round of 16 by wining all the group games. They topped the group by beating England 1-0 in last game in which both teams made more than 7 changes. Now they will face Japan, who manage to reach the next level on basis of fair play points.<br><br>
		With likes of Lukaku, Hazard and De Bruyne, Red Devils always look threatning team and the goal scoring record in recent past makes them even more threatning. Belgium have formidable defense too. With experiance of Courtois, Alderweireld and Vertonghen, Belgium defense looks solid.<br><br>
		Japan started their world cup campagin by shocking win over Colombia (2-1) followed by 2-2 draw with Senegal. They lost their last game against Polond but they able to reach Round of 16 because of less yellow cards than Senegal.
		<br><br>
		Japan is the only Asian hope remaining in this world cup. Blue Samurai have an uphill task of containing Belgium's attacking prowress. Belgium will start as favourites in this game, but you can't write off any team in this world cup. Haven't you??
