	<p class="prw">
		After dissapointment of not able to win in their first match against Portugal, Spain will come in this match to earn valubale 3 points with some goal mass action.<br>
		This will be easy contest for Spain, as Iran by any means won't look threatening. Iran will sit back deep and try to stop spaniard attacks.<br>
		Spain is able to keep only one clean sheet in last 6 games, but against this Iran side who haven't faced opponents of this level, they won't except any troubles from them.<br>
		Spain with their goal scoring record, they are hot favourites to win the match with huge goal difference.
		With Costa, Isco more likely to have more attempts at goal, It will intresting to see how many goals spain able to score in this match.

	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p> Spain will be come in this match with attacking mind. Through out 90 miniutes they will look to score. Iran is going to seat deep. Don't expect attacking threats from Iran. 7 Spain and 4 Iran players is must combination.</p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-4-2</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li> De Gea is selected in less than 35% of Dream11 team. He is world class GK. As their is confusion in 4th defender from Spain, you can go for him as safe option.</li><br>
		<li> It is difficult to predict who's gonna have assist and who's gonna score goals in this Spain side as all are creative players.</li><br>
		<li> Back your insticts while selecting any mid-fielder from Spain.</li>
		<li> Busquets is best and must pick at 8 credits.</li><br>
		<li> Costa with his goal scoring form, makes him must pick.</li><br>
		<li> It will be better to not to pick any defender from Iran.</li>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
		<li>Costa</li>
		<li>Isco</li>
		<li>Alba</li>
		<li>D. Silva</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li> Vazquez will be good pick. Coming from bench, He has ability to score. Asensio will other candidate for subs.
	</li>
	<li> J. Alba will very good pick as Captain in GL. Winger who always looks for goals. With a clean sheet is more likely, Worth a try.</li>
