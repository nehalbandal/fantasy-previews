	<p class="h">Fantasy Team Selection:</p>
	<p class="h">Outlook</p>
	<p> Attack Attack Attack!!! thats what this brazilian side is all about. Almost a guarantee. of minimum 2 goals. Better to go with 7 Brazilian & 4 Swiss players. </p>
	<dd class="dds" style="color: green">best Combination: 1-4-4-2</dd>

	<ul> 
		<li><dd class="dds">Goalkeeper (GK):</dd> Taking Sommer gives you extra option to add one extra attacker from Brazil. For safe side, Becker is good choice.          </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Defenders (DEF):</dd> Its on you whether to pick 4 or 3 defender from Brazil. Marcelo is must pick. Silva and Danilo are also good picks. From Swiss side, Rodriguez and Lichsteiner are best options. Pick one of them.  </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Mid-fielders (MID):</dd> Coutinho is mandatory pick. Willan and Casemiro are another best options. Prefer Willan. Xhaka & Shaqiri are excellent players. Pick both if you can manage credits. Behrami & Dzemaili are another considerable picks. </li><br>

		<li><dd class="dds">Forwards (ST):</dd> For me, Neymar & Jesus are must picks. Seferovic is best pick from Swiss side.       </li><br>
	</ul>

<p class="h">C & VC Options:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li> Neymar</li>
	<li> Coutinho</li>
	<li> Marcelo</li>
	<li> Jesus</li>
		
	</ul>

	<p class="h">Grand league tips:</p>
	<ul > 
	<li> Jesus and Willan are picked by less than 55% of people. Willan is excellent creative mid-fielder whereas Jesus is prolific striker. Worth to pick them.</li>
	<li> Casemiro is very underrated player from both national and club side. He is really fine player. Points with tackles, passes are sure from him. He surely going to have attempts at goal.</li>
	<li> Seferovic is good player. Can create and score goal. Try him in GL. Schar is another excellent pick from Swiss side in GL.</li>
	<li> Rodriguez is picked by less than 40% of people. Defender can score or create goals. Valuable pick. </li>
	</ul>
		

	<h3 class="atb">All the best</h3><br>
